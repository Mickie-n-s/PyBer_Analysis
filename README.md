# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

We were contracted to analyze rideshare data across a number of areas in order to determine usage and profitability across urban, suburban and rural areas. 

## Results

As shown in the chart below, there's a consistent split between the three different types of area. Urban areas are significantly higher in fare per month than suburban areas, and rural areas are significantly less productive still.

While the total fares in these areas are significantly slanted in favor of urban areas, the average fares per trip and per rider skew the opposite direction. This would suggest that riders in urban areas are taking more numerous but shorter trips when compared to the longer, more rare trips in rural areas.

## Summary

While the cities are certainly your most profitable market overall, the rural areas can be a massive source of high single-fare income. Finding ways to encourage city riders to go farther, through advertising or promotions, can help bridge this gap. 

In the rural environments, it appears that people are only using PyBer when they are needing to go over long distances, implying that most short trips are done by foot or by owned vehicles. This, too, could be improved by encouraging drivers to increase activity in rural areas with favorable compensation, as well as increasing awareness of your service via targeted advertising.
